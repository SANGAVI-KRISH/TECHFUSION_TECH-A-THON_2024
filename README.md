    **Mental Health Chat Bot**
**Introduction**

The Mental Health Chat Bot is a web application built with Streamlit that aims to support mental well-being by providing users with personalized relaxation tips and stress relief techniques. Leveraging the capabilities of the Ollama language model, the chatbot generates actionable advice based on user-provided mood or stress level inputs.

**Features**

•	Personalized Relaxation Tips: Offers tailored advice for stress relief based on user input.
•	Interactive Interface: Simple text input to describe mood or stress level.
•	Real-Time Responses: Provides immediate feedback and suggestions.
Requirements

To run this application, ensure you have the following:

•	Python 3.8+: The application is compatible with Python 3.8 and above.

•	Streamlit: For creating the web app interface.

•	LangChain Core: Core library for building language model chains.

•	LangChain Community: Community extensions and tools for language models.

•	Ollama: Language model used to generate responses.

**Installation**

Follow these steps to set up the environment and run the app:

**1.	Clone the Repository:**

git clone <repository_url>

cd <repository_directory>

**2.	Set Up the Virtual Environment:**

Create and activate a virtual environment:

o	"I've been anxious lately and need some advice."

o	"I am in a good mood but want to maintain it."

**Code Overview**

•	Prompt Template: Configures how the chat bot interacts with the language model. It guides the model to focus on providing actionable stress relief techniques.

•	Model Initialization: Uses the Ollama model to process user inputs and generate responses.

•	Output Parsing: Converts the raw output from the model into a readable string format for the user.

•	User Interaction: Processes and handles user inputs, and displays the generated advice on the interface.

**Troubleshooting**

•	Model Initialization Errors: Ensure you have the correct model name and verify that the model is properly configured.

•	Dependency Issues: Confirm all required libraries are installed and compatible with your Python version.

•	Connection Problems: If using a model that requires internet access, ensure your network connection is stable.

**Advanced Configuration**

•	Customizing Prompts: Modify the prompt template in the code to change the style or type of responses generated by the model.

•	Model Parameters: Adjust model parameters or switch models based on performance and response quality.
